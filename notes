-What content to download? 
	Title, paragraph, content, href
	Ignore things:  script, syntax elements ('<', '=', etc.)
-Preference to title?
-Crawl links, then download?
	Already have links; so start with that
	Can modify crawler to traverse URL list
-Study page sources to understand what useful things to scrape and what not to
-Character encoding issue
-Calculate tf-idf score for each term for each document
	Will serve as dimensions for the vector
	Each document will be a vector determined from tf-idf scores

-For a search:
	Make vector out of query terms
	Calculate vector distance from query to each document
	Doc that has smallest distance will be top hit
-Then combine with pagerank

-Need to cache url feed, some urls that didn't get requested will be requested when time comes
